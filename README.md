# chatbot_rasa_docker
This is a rasa chatbot including docker files and configurations, you can use this chatbot in docker containers.  
  
Because this program has been deployed on the server, it cannot be run in a local IDE (such as vscode, pycharm). You need to deploy it to docker and start it before it can run on the local web page.  
  
If you have deployed and started it on docker, you can open the web page and enter 'localhost:8088'. You will enter the rasa chatbot conversation web page. You can enter some designed conversations and check the effect.  
  
The design of the dialogue has been placed in story.txt, which you can use as a reference.  
  
The deployment method and configuration of docker will be introduced below.
